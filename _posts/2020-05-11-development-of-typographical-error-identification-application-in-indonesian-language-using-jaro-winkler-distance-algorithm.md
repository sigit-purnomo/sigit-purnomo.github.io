title:  "Development of Typographical Error Identification Application in Indonesian Language Using Jaro-Winkler Distance Algorithm"
excerpt: "Text is one of the media used by humans to communicate and interact every day, especially in the field of education, for example, in writing a final project report. The most common thing in writing text is typographical errors. Based on these problems, an application is needed to help the writer to be able to identify typographical errors in the Indonesian Language document. The application developed using Laravel version 5.8 for web application and Python version 3 for processing datasets, developing model, and developing web services. Model built uses the NLTK library and Jaro-Winkler distance algorithm implemented using the pylibjaro library. The dataset uses an open-source dataset in the form of a list of words from KBBI. This application only supports pdf files. The results of the model are applied to the web services with output in the form of JSON data. The JSON data contains a list of words that have true or false values, the number of document words, the number of correct words, the number of incorrect words, and the time of program execution."

**Abstract:** <br />
Text is one of the media used by humans to communicate and interact every day, especially in the field of education, for example, in writing a final project report. The most common thing in writing text is typographical errors. Based on these problems, an application is needed to help the writer to be able to identify typographical errors in the Indonesian Language document. The application developed using Laravel version 5.8 for web application and Python version 3 for processing datasets, developing model, and developing web services. Model built uses the NLTK library and Jaro-Winkler distance algorithm implemented using the pylibjaro library. The dataset uses an open-source dataset in the form of a list of words from KBBI. This application only supports pdf files. The results of the model are applied to the web services with output in the form of JSON data. The JSON data contains a list of words that have true or false values, the number of document words, the number of correct words, the number of incorrect words, and the time of program execution.
