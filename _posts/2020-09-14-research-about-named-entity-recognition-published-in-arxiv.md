Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a task in Information Extraction consisting in identifying and classifying just some types of information elements, called Named Entities (NE)[(Marrero, et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csi.2012.09.004). I have tried to collect and curate some publications form Arxiv that related to NER, and the results were listed here. Please enjoy it!
