Question Answering (QA) Systems is an automated approach to retrieve correct responses to the questions asked by human in natural language [Dwivedi & Singh, 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.protcy.2013.12.378).  I have tried to collect and curate some publications form Arxiv that related to question answering dataset, and the results were listed here. Please enjoy it!
