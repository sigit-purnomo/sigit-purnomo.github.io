Machine Translation ( MT) is the task of automatically converting one natural language to another, preserving the meaning of the input text, and producing fluent text in the output language. [(Stanford NLP Group, last access June 02, 2020)](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/mt.shtml). I have tried to collect and curate some publications form Arxiv that related to the multilingual machine translation, and the results were listed here. Please enjoy it!
