Multi-document summarization is an automatic process to create a concise and comprehensive document, called summary from multiple documents.  [(Rautrey & Balabantaray, 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aci.2017.05.003). I have tried to collect and curate some publications form Arxiv that related to multi document summarization, and the results were listed here. Please enjoy it!
