Aspect-based sentiment analysis deals with capturing sentiments expressed towards each aspect of entities. [(Mowlaei, et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2020.113234). I have tried to collect and curate some publications form Arxiv that related to the aspect-based sentiment analysis, and the results were listed here. Please enjoy it!
