The main objective of this tutorial is to give step-by-step guides for academia that wants to publish his/her academic portfolios using GitHub Pages.

### Step #1: Sign Up to GitHub 

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) website using your browser and klik the Sign Up button.

2. Fill the form to create new account. <br />
   **Note:** Please wisely choosing your username account. It will become the address of your GitHub Pages. As academia, known by your real name is very important, so if it is still available, I suggest setting the username like this: *firstnamelastname* or *firstname.lastname*.
