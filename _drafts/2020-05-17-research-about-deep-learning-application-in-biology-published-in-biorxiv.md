Deep learning is a set of machine learning algorithms that attempt to model high-level abstractions in input data using multiple non-linear transformations. Some of the major advances in deep learning have been made in speech recognition , computer vision, and natural language processing. Considering that data volume is growing exponentially, deep learning is becoming increasingly important in the predictive analysis of big data [(Li et. al, 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-805394-2.00004-0). I have tried to collect and curate some publications form bioRxiv that related to the deep learning application in biology, and the results were listed here. Please enjoy it!
