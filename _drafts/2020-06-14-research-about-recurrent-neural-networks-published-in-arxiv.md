Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a class of neural networks that are naturally suited to processing time-series data and other sequential data. [(DiPietro, et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-816176-0.00026-0). I have tried to collect and curate some publications form Arxiv that related to the recurrent neural networks, and the results were listed here. Please enjoy it!
