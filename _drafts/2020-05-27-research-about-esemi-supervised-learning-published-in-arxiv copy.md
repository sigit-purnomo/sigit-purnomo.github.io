Semi-supervised learning is a learning paradigm concerned with the study of how computers and natural systems, such as humans, learn in the presence of both labeled and unmarked data. [(Zhu & Goldberg, 2009)](https://doi.org/10.2200/S00196ED1V01Y200906AIM006). I have tried to collect and curate some publications form Arxiv that related to the semi-supervised learning, and the results were listed here. Please enjoy it!
