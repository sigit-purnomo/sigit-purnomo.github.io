The main objective of extractive summarization can be concisely formulated as extracting text inputs containing information on the most important concepts described in the input text or texts. [(Filatova et. al., 2004)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W04-1017). I have tried to collect and curate some publications form Arxiv that related to the abstractive summarization, and the results were listed here. Please enjoy it!
