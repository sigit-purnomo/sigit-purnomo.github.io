excerpt: "An LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network that addresses the vanishing gradient problem in vanilla RNNs through additional cells, input and output gates. This RNN type introduced by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber. I have tried to collect and curate some Python-based Github repository linked to the LSTM, and the results were listed here. Please enjoy it to support your research about LSTM using Python! "

An LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network that addresses the vanishing gradient problem in vanilla RNNs through additional cells, input and output gates. This RNN type introduced by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber [(Papers with Code, 2020)](https://paperswithcode.com/method/lstm). I have tried to collect and curate some Python-based Github repository linked to the LSTM, and the results were listed here. Please enjoy it to support your research about LSTM using Python!
